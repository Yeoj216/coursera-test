  	<p id="p3">A true pioneer in laziness this young man wastes away his life on worthless youtube videos. Although being the quiet and shy kid in his group he has provided brilliant ides in the past.His hobbies include playing chinese poker and 8ball pool. You can measure how tired he is by the level of his jokes, the more tired the worse they get.
